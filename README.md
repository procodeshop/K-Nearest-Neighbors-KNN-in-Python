K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the k nearest data points to a given input and making predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression).

KNN is a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm, meaning it does not make strong assumptions about the data and only performs computations when making predictions.
